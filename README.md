AKA the art critic of Babel if you are feeling funny. This is an AI made for the sole purpose of sifting through randomly generated images (Canvas of Babel) and trying to find meaning. It's a very small model and on my rtx 2060 it managed to zoom through about 70,000 images a second. Inspired by Solar Sands' [Canvas of Babel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awpVjv2-Ow0) It also explains the concept well if my description isn't enough for you. It is in now way a viable solution to generating images, but I find it very funny and interesting as a concept. If you are intrigued, you can try your luck at finding the next Van Gogh painting on the Canvas of Babel.

## Why make this and what's a Babel ? (**I SWEAR THIS IS INTERESTING**)

The concept originates from a short story written by Jorge Luis Borges titled "The Library of Babel". The book is about a hypothetical library containing 410 page books filled with every single possible combination of characters(shush, I know it's less). This means that most of the books are complete gibberish. However, it also means that in the endless shelves one can find a vivid description of their future wedding, a transcript of their every dream, and a hitlist on everybody on Earth that likes pineapple on Pizza (This README is there too). 

This concept was adapted as a website at https://libraryofbabel.info/. If you have some time you are looking to waste you can try to navigate the library yourself. The website creator also expanded the idea to art with the Canvas of Babel. A set of all of all 416x640 images using 4096 colors, making **4096^266240 images**. Containing anything from screenshots of every Library of Babel book, your birth, wedding, and funeral, on top of all yet-to-be-posted memes out there. In my case I decided to limit my Canvas of Babel to 64x64 greyscale images, bringing the number of possible images to a measly **1 Ã— 10^12288**. This will be sure to dissapoint all the immortal fans in the audience. This is what they AI is sifting through for days.
