AKA the art critic of Babel if you are feeling funny. This is an AI made for the sole purpose of sifting through randomly generated images (Canvas of Babel) and trying to find meaning. It's a very small model and on my rtx 2060 it managed to zoom through about 70,000 images a second. Inspired by Solar Sands' [Canvas of Babel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awpVjv2-Ow0) It also explains the concept well if my description isn't enough for you. It is in now way a viable solution to generating images, but I find it very funny and interesting as a concept. If you are intrigued, you can try your luck at finding the next Van Gogh painting on the Canvas of Babel.
